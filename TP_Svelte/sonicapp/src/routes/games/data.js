        plot: "<div class=\"m-3\">Learning of a secret weapon from the diary of his deceased grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Doctor Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. (Guardian Units of Nations) facility and revives it using a Chaos Emerald. The weapon – a black hedgehog and self-proclaimed 'Ultimate Life Form' named Shadow – offers to help Eggman conquer the world, telling him to rendezvous at an abandoned space colony, the ARK, with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow goes to Central City, encountering G.U.N.'s forces after stealing an Emerald. Shadow has vowed to fulfill a promise to Gerald's granddaughter, Maria, right before she died, which he interprets as one of revenge. Shadow blasts through the military force and meets Sonic. After a brief confrontation, Shadow escapes and G.U.N. captures Sonic, whom they mistake for Shadow. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Meanwhile, Knuckles encounters Rouge and Eggman, who both try to steal the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering the Emerald and searches for the scattered shards to repair it. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another super-weapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with the Chaos Emeralds and use it to take over the world. Rouge joins forces with them, offering them a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Tails and Amy infiltrate G.U.N.'s island base and rescue Sonic, while Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island. Eggman makes a global broadcast threatening to fire on the Earth in 24 hours if his demands are not met, demonstrating the cannon's power by using it to destroy half the Moon using their six Emeralds. While avoiding G.U.N. forces, Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles use a Chaos Emerald in their possession to track down the others on the ARK. They infiltrate Eggman's base, boarding his shuttle shortly before it launches into space. Knuckles' Master Emerald shards are spilled along the way, and he leaves to collect them. He fights Rouge again, but when he saves her from falling into a lava pit, she relinquishes her shards and he restores the Master Emerald. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> On the ARK, Tails reveals he has made a counterfeit Chaos Emerald to destroy the Eclipse Cannon. As Sonic is about to use it, Eggman tells him that he has captured Tails and Amy, forcing him to return and rescue them. Sonic tries to trick Eggman with the fake Emerald, but Eggman sees through the plan and jettisons him in an escape pod rigged with explosives. Tails, thinking Sonic is dead, fights and defeats Eggman. Sonic uses the power of the fake Emerald to initiate 'Chaos Control' and escape; Shadow is sent to intercept him. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Regardless of who wins the fight, Eggman sneaks away from Tails and Amy with the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. The entire colony suddenly starts falling, and a prerecorded message from Gerald is broadcast globally: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including Maria. Everyone but Shadow works together to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Amy pleads for Shadow's help, allowing him to remember what Maria really requested of Shadow: for him to help mankind. Shadow catches up with Sonic and Knuckles in the core as they encounter the Biolizard, a prototype Ultimate Life Form. Shadow repels it, allowing Knuckles to deactivate the Chaos Emeralds with the Master Emerald. The Biolizard uses Chaos Control to fuse with the cannon, becoming the Finalhazard and continuing the ARK's collision course. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Sonic and Shadow use the Emeralds to transform into their super forms, defeating the Finalhazard and using Chaos Control to teleport the ARK back into stable orbit. This depletes Shadow's energy and he plummets to Earth, content in fulfilling his promise to Maria. The people on Earth celebrate as the heroes return home, and Sonic bids Shadow farewell. </div>"

Detecting a threat signature, Sage ceases hijacking the portal and initiates a protection protocol, dragging Eggman into an artificial dimension called Cyber Space. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Sonic, Tails and Amy investigate activity that has drawn the Chaos Emeralds to the islands, but their plane is sucked into a wormhole to Cyber Space. Sonic escapes to the islands in the real world, where a disembodied voice tasks him with finding the emeralds and destroying the island's robotic Titans to remove the boundary between the real and digital worlds. Believing this will save his friends – including Knuckles, who was transported there while exploring the ruins above Angel Island – Sonic releases their digital forms from cages created by Sage, who works to free Eggman from Cyber Space; destroying the cages causes Sonic's body to become increasingly corrupted. Sage cautions Sonic to leave, influencing the islands' mechanical guardians and Titans to attack him, but grows to sympathize with him while observing his interactions with his friends, and forms a mutual familial bond with Eggman. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> Through visions of the local Koco, Sonic and his friends learn the history of the Ancients, who are revealed to be an extraterrestrial race whose planet was destroyed by The End, an all-powerful entity. The Ancients used the Chaos Emeralds to escape and were drawn to the Master Emerald on Earth, but The End followed and started to wipe out their new civilization. The Titans were built to seal The End within Cyber Space, with the Ancients' essences remaining within the Koco, which become inert once Sonic and his friends help them fulfill their final desires in life. </div><div class=\"m-3\"> After destroying three of the Titans and disabling the towers that maintain the spatial boundary, Sonic succumbs to his corruption and is trapped between dimensions. Released along with his friends and Eggman, Sonic's guide reveals itself to be The End, which attacks Earth using the last Titan, Supreme. Sonic's friends purge the corruption from him by sacrificing their physical forms, while Sage and Eggman help him collect the scattered Chaos Emeralds, allowing him to defeat Supreme. When The End flees into space, Sage uses Supreme to assist Sonic against The End's true form, sacrificing herself to destroy it. Sonic's friends are restored and leave the islands with him, now wishing to make a difference in their lives after their new experience, while Eggman revives Sage using the island's technology.</div><div class=\"m-3\"> 'Another Story' is an alternate climax featured in the game's 'Final Horizon' update. Following his friends' sacrifice, Sonic accepts a proposal from Sage to restore them along with his cyber corruption, which he may convert into greater power to use against The End. Returning to their holographic forms, Sonic's friends retrieve the Chaos Emeralds while he undergoes trials overseen by the souls of the Titans' pilots and the Ancients' leader, Master King. After Sonic receives the Ancients' blessings and is cured of his corruption, Master King grants him temporary control over the cyber energy, which Sonic combines with his super form to destroy Supreme and The End. Afterwards, Sonic reunites with his newly freed friends, while Eggman and Sage happily return home as a family. </div>"
