# Chloe Lidec projects

Here you can find all the projects I finished, wether at school or by myself.

## JDBC

Here is a quick exemple of the use of JDBC I did for school.

## Système

In this directory, you can find few files in bash that I made for me to be able to create my configuration faster when I use the school's computers. It has been updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane and is now able to show windows to select more easily what I want to do.

## Cyber attack at IUT'O

In this directory, you can find all the files needed to launch the "cyber_attack_at_iuto.py" file in the source repretory. It's a little trojan game I created along with two of my classmates for a project in my first year of BUT Informatique.

## Pendu

In this directory, you can find all the files needed to launch the Pendu.java which is an application based on the game Hangman. I created this application during
my first year of BUT Informatique.

## Demineur

In this directory, you can find all the files needed to launch the DemineurGraphique.java which is an application of the game Mines.
I coded this game along with three classmates for a school project.

## Allo45 Application

It's an application that I developped along with four classmates for a imaginary company. There's two modules, one for an analyst and one for a pollster. You can't launch the app directly, you'll need to launch a podman first and load the database with the creation files. 
It was updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane.
