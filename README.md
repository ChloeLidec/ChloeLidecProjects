## Work projects

### Airmust

While working for Airmust, I was able to develop multiple things. Firstly, I continued redesigning the website wether it was on the front or the back end. The website was a Prestashop 8 website and I did core changements to it (CSS or modifying simple parts of the website) as well as major changements when I developped multiple modules for it.

The languages I used were PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Symfony

A major part of the modules I added were for back office features such as commissions calculation for the commercials, reorganisation of the back office for a clearer interface, specific prices management or other implementations to fit the needs of the company. I also added small features to the front to make the clients path on our website easier.

I also did a complete redesigning of the other website of the company to make it more modern and adapt it to the clients' use. For exemple, I developped a module for the clients to be able to choose a specific weight or personalize it and the price would be calculated accordingly. I also added customized forms so the potential clients could send messages to the company to show their interest in a specific part of our catalog.

For those two websites, I was also responsible for the maintenance and assisting the users when they had special needs or functionalities they wished to add to the Prestashop.

During this job, I also did technical maintenance on computers and electronicals machines and developped python programms, apps scripts programs or bash programms to optimize a few of the processes.

## Personnal projects

On my personnal time, I helped developped a Wordpress website, and also developped a Prestashop 9 online shop.

I also am creating a video game from scratch (from the story to the developpement of the game)

## Repo

In this repository you can find all the projects I have completed, wether at school or by myself.

### Airplane_war

In this repository is a game that I created along with one of my classmates. All the information about it is in the README file of the directory.
It was updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane.

### Allo45

It's an application that I developped along with four classmates for an imaginary company. There are two modules, one for an analyst and one for a pollster. You can't launch the app directly, you'll need to launch a podman first and load the database with the creation files. 
It was updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane.

### Demineur

In this directory, you can find all the files needed to launch the DemineurGraphique.java which is an application of the game Mines.
I coded this game along with three classmates for a school project.

### Pendu

In this directory, you can find all the files needed to launch the Pendu.java which is an application based on the game Hangman. I created this application during
my first year of BUT Informatique.

### Projet Gestion Soutien

In this directory, you will see a projetct I did during my third year of BUT with Axel Jacquet, Téo Mikulic and Tom Germain. It's a website made using the Django framework that responded to one of our teacher's requirements  for an application that will help manage the tutoring of first years. You will find a README with more details in the folder.

### Projet specialisé 2023

This is a game I made in Unity during my session at the Cegep of Matane. It's a 3D mobile game where you can do missions and explore the map. Read the README in the directory for more information.

### Site Flask

In this folder is a web application that I created during my Web lessons. It uses Flask and is connected to a database. It's a simple website that allows you to create an account, browse the database and add/change data.

### SiteWebQuizzJS

In this directory is a website not connected to a server that I made for school for a project that consisted in using JS to create some quizzes.
It was updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane.

### Système

In this directory, you can find a few files in bash that I made to be able to create my configuration faster when I use the school's computers. It has been updated by a maintenance during my semester at the Cegep of Matane and now has an interface to select what I want to do.

## TP Svelte

This is a website I developped with Téo Mikulic during my last year of BUT for a test in which we had to make a website using svelte components to show our understanding of the technology that is Svelte. You can read more details in the README file in the folder.

## Internships projects

During the different interships I did all throughout my school years, I took part in a few projects that I can't share in details because I don't own them. In this next part, I will summarize them to show more of my experience.

### Web Application for the Conseil départemental du Loiret

During my second year in the IUT of Orléans, I did my internship in the Conseil départemental du Loiret and my goal was to developp a website that would compile data about
the IT service I was in. I had to collect information on one of the company's application, inject it in my database and use it on the site so that the data was comprehensible.
The website was developped in PHP and Javascript and I also did a bit of CSS. 

### Web ERP for a client of ZE-Company

For my third year in the IUT, my internship was with ZE-Company. During this intership, I took part in many different projects, the main one being the developpement of an ERP for a client. It was being developped based on an already existing Symfony application of the company but we had to upgrade it and make it into a general bundle. I not only used the Symfony framework but also the different web languages and a few Symfony bundles such as EasyAdmin.

### Help on Wordpress and Prestashop websites for ZE-Company's clients

After my work on the main project I had during my internship at ZE-Company was done, I helped on little things on different Wordpress or Prestashop based websites. I mainly did backend with short code creation for Wordpress and modules developpement for Prestashop. I also overwrote a few of already existing modules in Prestashop in order to get what we needed for the client. Lastly, I used ACF in Wordpress and short codes to create publications for a client who then only had to enter information and it was already organized.

### Detection with AI program for ZE-Company

The last project during my intership at ZE-Company was to develop an AI program. I will not explain in details because of confidentiality but the main idea was to write a code in Python using Yolo-v8 (an already trained AI model) to create an AI adapted to our needs and then I also connected my program to Google Maps APIs to achieve the goal.
